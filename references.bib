  abstract  = {Summary The coverage distance, or service standard, was exogenously specified in the set covering and maximum covering models of Chapter 4 and the extensions of those models. The center problem treats the coverage distance as an endogenous decision variable. The center problem locates a fixed number of facilities to minimize the maximum distance between any demand node and the nearest facility to that demand node. The absolute center model allows facilities to be located anywhere on the network while the vertex center model restricts facility locations to the nodes. Unweighted problems treat each demand node identically while weighted problems allow nodes to be valued or weighted differently. Polynomial algorithms for the absolute 1- and 2-center problems on an unweighted tree network are presented as is an algorithm for the absolute 1-center on a weighted tree. The vertex center problem on a general graph is then discussed, followed by a discussion of algorithms for the absolute center problem on a general graph.}
