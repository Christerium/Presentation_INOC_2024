abstract = {Summary The coverage distance, or service standard, was exogenously specified in the set covering and maximum covering models of Chapter 4 and the extensions of those models. The center problem treats the coverage distance as an endogenous decision variable. The center problem locates a fixed number of facilities to minimize the maximum distance between any demand node and the nearest facility to that demand node. The absolute center model allows facilities to be located anywhere on the network while the vertex center model restricts facility locations to the nodes. Unweighted problems treat each demand node identically while weighted problems allow nodes to be valued or weighted differently. Polynomial algorithms for the absolute 1- and 2-center problems on an unweighted tree network are presented as is an algorithm for the absolute 1-center on a weighted tree. The vertex center problem on a general graph is then discussed, followed by a discussion of algorithms for the absolute center problem on a general graph.}

abstract = {The p-center problem (pCP) is a fundamental problem in location science, where we are given customer demand points and possible facility locations, and we want to choose p of these locations to open a facility such that the maximum distance of any customer demand point to its closest open facility is minimized. State-of-the-art solution approaches of pCP use its connection to the set cover problem to solve pCP in an iterative fashion by repeatedly solving set cover problems. The classical textbook integer programming (IP) formulation of pCP is usually dismissed due to its size and bad linear programming (LP)-relaxation bounds. We present a novel solution approach that works on a new IP formulation that can be obtained by a projection from the classical formulation. The formulation is solved by means of branch-and-cut, where cuts for demand points are iteratively generated. Moreover, the formulation can be strengthened with combinatorial information to obtain a much tighter LP-relaxation. In particular, we present a novel way to use lower bound information to obtain stronger cuts. We show that the LP-relaxation bound of our strengthened formulation has the same strength as the best known bound in literature, which is based on a semi-relaxation. Finally, we also present a computational study on instances from the literature with up to more than 700,000 customers and locations. Our solution algorithm is competitive with highly sophisticated set-cover-based solution algorithms, which depend on various components and parameters.}

In this note we show that it is possible to enhance that algorithm to solve (optimally) problems having up to 900 vertices using the Cray-1S computer.}

These results are used to find the optimum location of a “switching center” in a communication network and to locate the best place to build a “police station” in a highway system. It is shown that the optimum location of a switching center is always at a vertex of the communication network while the best location for the police station is not necessarily at an intersection. Procedures for finding these locations are given. }

abstract = {This paper deals with a multi-period extension of the p-center problem, in which arc traversal times vary over time, and facilities are mobile units that can be relocated multiple times during the planning horizon. The problem arises in several applications, such as emergency services, in which vehicles can be relocated in anticipation of traffic congestion. First, we analyze the problem structure and its relationship with its single-period counterpart, considered as a special case. Then, the insight gained with this analysis is used to devise a decomposition heuristic. Computational results on instances based on the Paris (France) road graph indicate that the algorithm is capable of determining good-quality solutions in a reasonable execution time.}

 abstract = {Problems of finding p-centers and dominating sets of radius r in networks are discussed in this paper. Let n be the number of vertices and |E| be the number of edges of a network. With the assumption that the distance-matrix of the network is available, we design an $O(|E| \cdot n \cdot \lg n)$ algorithm for finding an absolute 1-center of a vertex-weighted network and an $O(|E| \cdot n + n^2 \cdot \lg n)$ algorithm for finding an absolute 1-center of a vertex-unweighted network (the problem of finding a vertex 1-center of a network is trivial). We show that the problem of finding a (vertex or absolute) p-center (for $1 < p < n)$ of a (vertex-weighted or vertex-unweighted) network, and the problem of finding a dominating set of radius r are NP-hard even in the case where the network has a simple structure (e.g., a planar graph of maximum vertex degree 3). However, we describe an algorithm of complexity $O \lbrack (|E|^p \cdot n^{2p - 1}/(p - 1)!) \lg n \rbrack$ (respectively, O [ |E|p · n2p - 1/(p - 1)! ]) for finding an absolute p-center in a vertex-weighted (respectively, vertex-unweighted) network. We proceed by discussing the problems of finding p-centers and dominating sets of networks whose underlying graphs are trees. When the network is a vertex-weighted tree, we obtain the following algorithms: An $O(n \cdot \lg n)$ algorithm for finding the (vertex or absolute) 1-center; an O(n) algorithm for finding a (vertex or absolute) dominating set of radius r; an $O(n^2 \cdot \lg n)$ algorithm for finding a (vertex or absolute) p-center for any $1 < p < n$. Some generalizations of these problems are discussed. When the network is a vertex-unweighted tree, O(n) algorithms for finding the (vertex or absolute) 1-center and an absolute 2-center are already known; we extend these results by giving an $O(n \cdot \lg^{p - 2} n)$ algorithm for finding an absolute p-center (where $3 \leqq p < n)$ and an $O(n \cdot \lg^{p - 1} n)$ algorithm for finding a vertex p-center (where $2 \leqq p < n)$. In part II we treat the p-median problem.},
